7 Penemuan Besar Stephen Hawking yang Akan Dikenang Sepanjang Masa</h2>


   
    <h3>1. He worked on things that made a scene related to the singularity, with Roger Penrose</h3>
      <P> Gravitational singularity is a one-dimensional point that contains unlimited mass in an infinite small space. Together with Roger Penrose, Hawking tried to prove the existence of a singularity and stated that the universe was most likely starting with a singularity. This theorem tries to answer when gravity produces a singularity.</p>
    
    <h3> 2. Hawking was part of the team that discovered the 4 laws of black hole mechanics</h3>
      <p>These found mechanical laws are believed to be characteristic of black holes and are analogous to thermodynamic theory. In January 1971, his essay entitled "Black Holes" won the prestigious Gravity Research Foundation Award</p>

   <h3> 3. The most significant theory of it is the black hole that emits Hawking Radiation</h3>
     <p> Many physicists believe that nothing can come out "safe" from a black hole. In 1974, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes emit radiation, which will continue until the energy runs out and evaporates. This initially controversial prediction was named Hawking Radiation and was considered an important breakthrough in theoretical physics.</p>

   <h3> 4. Hawking also contributed to the theory of cosmic inflation</h3>
     <p> Stephen Hawking is one who calculates quantum fluctuations, which are formed during cosmic inflation. Hawking showed how this phenomenon could increase the spread of galaxies in the universe. In 1980, cosmic inflation was initially introduced by Alan Guth.</p>

   <h3> 5. Together with James Hartle, Hawking mentions that the universe has no origin point</h3>
     <p> Hawking and Hartle found that time did not exist before the Big Bang. They concluded that the beginning of the universe was meaningless, because the universe according to Hawking and Hartle did not have a starting point, just as there is no first limit, both in terms of space and time. Until now, this theory became the most prominent theory about the beginning of the universe, which without involving religious understanding.</p>

   <h3> 6. Hawking proposed the "top-down cosmology" theory, together with Thomas Hertog</h3>
     <p> This theory states that the universe does not have a unique initial state but consists of superpositions of many initial conditions, which may occur. So because we don't know the initial conditions of the universe, we can't use a bottom-up model. This makes possible only the top-down approach, as we know about the final state of the universe, which we face today. This theory became very popular because it fits into the famous string theory.</p>

   <h3> 7. Hawking wrote a famous book entitled "A Brief History of Time" as well as several other popular books</h3>
     <p> In 1988, a Hawking book entitled "A Brief History of Time" was published. In it, he explained various topics about cosmology; including the big bang, black holes and light cones. The book was written in non-technical languages ​​to clearly convey his ideas to lay readers. Stephen Hawking has proven that you will not lose hope for anything. When he was sentenced to a short age at the age of 21, he did not give up and proved that his illness could develop slowly. He survived to age 76 by giving birth to many great discoveries, regardless of the controversy. RIP Stephen Hawking (1942-2018).</p>
